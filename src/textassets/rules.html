      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <h3>Dealing</h3>
      <p>
        The dealer shuffles and deals 13 cards face down to each player, one at
        a time, moving clockwise.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Starting the Play</h3>
      <p>
        The player with the 3 of Diamonds must start by playing it, either as a
        single card or in a combination (explained below).
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Playing a Round</h3>
      <p>
        Players take turns clockwise, trying to play a higher-valued combination
        than the one played before. Here are the playable combinations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single Card: One card, higher than the previous single.</li>
        <li>Pair: Two cards of the same rank (e.g., two 10s).</li>
        <li>
          Straight: Five consecutive cards of any suit (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of
          mixed suits).
        </li>
        <li>Flush: Five cards of the same suit (e.g., all Diamonds).</li>
        <li>
          Full House: Three cards of the same rank and a pair (e.g., three Jacks
          and two 5s).
        </li>
        <li>
          Quads (Four of a kind): Four cards of the same rank (e.g., four
          Queens).
        </li>
        <li>
          Straight Flush: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 10, J,
          Q, K, A of Hearts).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />

      <h3>Passing</h3>
      <p>
        If a player cannot play a higher-valued combination, they can choose to
        "pass".
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>The "3 Pass" Rule</h3>
      <p>
        If three consecutive players pass, the last player who played a valid
        combination gains control. They can start a new round by playing any
        valid combination of their choice.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Winning the Round</h3>
      <p>The first player to discard all their cards wins the round.</p>
